# Project Overview

#  Application Specifications:

###  Users Are Able To:
- Create Raffles
- List All Raffles
- Add Particular Users To Raffles
- Draw A Winner From Raffles


I used frontend to make this app functionable. These technologies are listed below.

For the frontend, I decided to use REACT. This library was set up to border core components with their state under each corresponding folder. For routing, I used react-router-dom that let me set up individual pages. I mainly used material UI to design the buttons and create cards that shows information for each participant in the raffle, as well as cards that showed the name of each raffle that was created, as well as the winner of those raffles. 



I hope you all enjoy the app. Feel free to reach out for any questions, comments or concerns!
